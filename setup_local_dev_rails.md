# `code` Command in Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

In the context of Visual Studio Code (VSCode), the `code` command in the PATH refers to a command-line interface tool provided by VSCode that allows you to open files and folders directly from the command line.

Adding VSCode to the PATH enables you to open VSCode from any directory in your command line or terminal without needing to provide the full path to the VSCode executable.

1. Open VSCode.
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P` (on macOS) or `Ctrl+Shift+P` (on Windows/Linux) to open the Command Palette.
3. Start typing `Install 'code' command in PATH`.
4. Select the option **"Install 'code' command in PATH"**.
